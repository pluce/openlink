## What OpenLink is

OpenLink is an open-source datalink project in active development.

The original goal is to provide a modern alternative to legacy virtual-network datalink
setups while staying practical for aircraft and ATC client developers.

Today, the first CPDLC server implementation is already usable for development and demos,
but the project is **not production-ready yet**.

## Who it is for

### Virtual ATC teams

OpenLink targets controller-side workflows that need consistent behavior across
sectors and handoffs:

- reliable online/offline presence,
- explicit active/inactive data authority,
- shared session truth across handoffs,
- predictable CPDLC dialogue closure rules.

### Virtual airline ops / dispatch ecosystems

OpenLink also targets airline-ops and EFB/FMS integration work:

- standardized message envelopes and routing,
- easy-to-implement API layer for avionics software,
- clear, structured protocol specs for integrators,
- scalability from small servers to large station counts.

## Current vision

OpenLink is designed to be:

- **network-agnostic** (and potentially multi-network in the future),
- **protocol-extensible** (CPDLC first, then other ACARS apps like DCL/AOC/D-ATIS),
- **secure by design** (OIDC/JWT aligned with the parent network identity),
- **event-driven and scalable** through queue-based message processing.

## Why this approach is different

Compared with "just implement CPDLC payloads" approaches, OpenLink focuses on
an operational stack:

	<Card title="Beyond one protocol" icon="open-book">
		CPDLC is the first implementation, but the architecture is meant to carry other
		ACARS applications and potentially non-ACARS protocols too.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Event-driven core" icon="seti:terminal">
		Messages go through a queue and are processed by server workers, which helps absorb
		load peaks and scale more cleanly.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Network-native security" icon="shield-check">
		Identity is tied to the underlying network authentication flow (OIDC/JWT), enabling
		clean network isolation and stronger station identity guarantees.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Thin client integrations" icon="code">
		A lot of CPDLC/session logic is handled server-side, so aircraft and ATC clients can
		integrate faster with less protocol complexity.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Close to IRL protocol semantics" icon="check">
		The wire format is implementation-friendly, while protocol behavior remains aligned
		with real CPDLC logic. A gateway to character-based formats is possible later.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Project status

Current state:

- first working CPDLC server,
- prototype GUI (aircraft DCDU + ATSU style),
- CLI and load-test tooling,
- ongoing integration work for real client ecosystems.

This is a community-driven open-source project: stable enough to explore,
integrate, and contribute — still evolving before production-grade maturity.
