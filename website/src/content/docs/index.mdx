## What you can do with OpenLink

OpenLink provides an implementation-ready foundation for ACARS/CPDLC operations.

With OpenLink, teams can:

- exchange CPDLC operational messages,
- run realistic session/presence workflows,
- integrate quickly via SDKs,
- validate behavior with shared conformance fixtures.

## Documentation map

This documentation is organized around four questions.

## Current maturity

OpenLink is currently suitable for development, integration prototyping, and conformance work.

It is still evolving and should be treated as pre-production software.
